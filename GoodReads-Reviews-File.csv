I've read a lot of books that make no sense or left me thinking, WHAT THE FUDGE? or were simply pointless, but this play was just POINTLESS. A Big-Foot-DOES-Exist kind of pointless (because he doesn't exist, if you get what I mean). Yes, the story was focused on the point, but that is it. It was like the playwright (I am supposed to call him that, right?) dashed like lightning to the point. It mainly talks about this dude and his friend coming from the South to sell watermelons and sell the dude's family antiquated piano to raise money to buy a piece of land where his ancestors worked on during the dark ages of slavery, but his sister's like: NO! but he is too dumb and persistent to understand. That's the point of the story. The playwright then adds random, irrelevant moments and speeches and the entire time I'd been reading I was like: *head lolled back; mouth open; drooling.*

It's a fast read though, if you can stand boring, superfluous books or plays. Terribly stupid and boring as it was, at least it was understandable, unlike Shakespeare's plays (but Shakespearean plays are TOTALLY another thing)","1-5-stars, 2011, bleh,classics, play, review, wt-huh"1,3/1/2018,Somehow this play won the Pulitzer in 1990. This play almost reaches O'Neill levels of circling the same topic. A brother wants to sell a piano. The sister does not. Back and forth it goes.,1,3/22/2023,"The characters didn’t have distinguished voices to me, it was hard to feel for them. The plot was slow and slightly boring.

school read",2,7/6/2021,"The Piano Lesson is a 1987 play by American playwright August Wilson. It is the fourth play in Wilson's The Pittsburgh Cycle. It was recommended to me by the lovely Yamini.

Wilson began writing this play by playing with the various answers regarding the possibility of “acquir[ing] a sense of self-worth by denying one's past”. However, on finishing his play, Wilson found the ending to stray from the empowered Berniece as well as from the question regarding self-worth. What The Piano Lesson finally seems to ask is: “What do you do with your legacy, and how do you best put it to use?”

Set in 1936 Pittsburgh during the aftermath of the Great Depression, The Piano Lesson follows the lives of the Charles family in the Doaker Charles household and an heirloom, the family piano. The play focuses on the arguments between a brother and a sister who have different ideas on what to do with the piano. The brother, Boy Willie, is a sharecropper who wants to sell the piano to buy the land (Sutter's land) where his ancestors toiled as slaves. The sister, Berniece, remains emphatic about keeping the piano, which shows the carved faces of their great-grandfather's wife and son during the days of their enslavement.

Generations earlier, Sutter, their family's slave-owner, broke up a family by selling a mother and child to pay for the piano which he bought for his wife as an anniversary present. The wife was happy with the piano but missed having the slaves (…white people, I tell you…), so Sutter had that family's husband/father (who was a carpenter and too valuable to sell), carve their likenesses on the piano. He carved likenesses of his entire history on the piano. In 1911, Boy Willie's father stole the piano from the Sutters; in retaliation he was killed. Willie declares that these are stories of the past and that the piano should now be put to good use.

Unable to understand the importance of keeping one's legacy around one to understand and grow from it, Boy Willie only concerns himself with labels and capital. In the last scene of the book, after Berniece calls to the ancestors, Boy Willie finally understands that there is no escape from living his ancestral legacy and the only way to benefit from it is to learn from it. Berniece symbolizes the guardian of her ancestors' past. She remains the only member of the family to adamantly demand the keepsake of the piano heirloom.
DOAKER:Now, that’s how all that got started and that why we say Berniece ain’t gonna sell that piano. Cause her daddy died over it.
…
BOY WILLIE: And he died over giving me that. I ain’t gonna let it sit up there and rot without trying to do something with it.
…
BERNIECE: Money can’t buy what that piano cost. You can’t sell your soul for money.
…
BOY WILLIE: But Doaker say you ain’t touched that piano the whole time it’s been up here. So why you wanna stand in my way? See, you just looking at the sentimental value.
I chose these quotes to showcase the argumentation/ train of thought that runs through the play. Both sides offer plausible and substantial arguments, albeit it quickly becomes clear that Wilson wants the reader to take Berniece's side. Due to the fact that I couldn't connect to any of the characters it remained easier for me to stay on neutral grounds. I understood both sides and where they were coming from.

Boy Willie is definitely the more immature, naive and selfish one, but in that regard he kind of reminded me of a young Malcolm X, or the character of Richard in Baldwin's Blues For Mister Charlie, or even Walter Younger from Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun. A man who is so fed up with the boundaries that a racist society and fucked up system set for him that he only sees one way to break out of it: money. He genuinely wants to better his life situation and standard of living, and he doesn't have many means at his disposal, so he turns to the only valuable family heirloom he (partly) owns.

He's a good man at heart. He doesn't want his niece to feel less worthy because ""she wasn't born a boy"" (something her mother accuses her of in a fury). He calls Berniece out for making her daughter think ""she wrong in the world. Like there ain’t no part of it belong to her."" But by doing just that, he neglects to acknowledge that everything is easier in theory. He is not the one who has raised Maretha for the last 11 years on his own. He is not the one who has to make sure that there's food on the table, their clothes are washed. It's easy to talk about those things and give advice when you're removed from the situation. Nonetheless, his tender side is able to come through in a few moments of vulnerability:
What I want to bring a child into this world for? I ain’t got no advantages to offer nobody.
Despite trying to free himself from racial boundaries, despite trying not to give shit about ""what the white man says"", Boy Willie knows that his options are limited, that his fate is prescribed, that this society he is forced to live in has reserved no space for him, no space for his family, and thus also no space for his would-be kids. I wish this side of his character would've been explored more.

Similarly, I felt that Berniece remained quite flat throughout the play. I wanted to love her and her empowered feminist speeches, but they remained lifeless and emotionless to me. I attribute it mainly to Wilson's writing style that I just couldn't seem to click with. I think this is one of those plays that is better seen played out on stage than simply read. Due to that, the play couldn't build the right atmosphere for me. It didn't feel like it displayed the 1930s in an authentic way, Wilson didn't quite manage to encapsulate the spirit and the way of talking of the time. I'm curious to know if his other plays of The Pittsburgh Cycle feel more genuine.

August Wilson is by no means a bad playwright and I appreciate what he tried to do with this particular project... but as of right now, I am not overly impressed with him. My heart and mind is still open though.",black-writers2,2/12/2021,"I really struggled to connect with this fourth play in August Wilson's Century Cycle, a bit of a surprise considering it won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1990.

Set in 1936, it tells the story of Berniece, a widow and single mother still grieving the tragic death of her husband several years earlier, and her younger brother ""Boy Willie,"" an energetic, ambitious entrepreneur who returns from the South to show up on the doorstep of their Uncle's Pittsburgh home early one morning.

Boy Willie wants to sell their family piano, whose legs were engraved by an enslaved ancestor with intricate images from their family history, so he can purchase a plot of land and establish himself as a self-sufficient and successful businessman. Berniece, however, refuses to go along with her brother's wishes, stubbornly clinging to the piano as a hard-earned, blood-soaked, priceless family heirloom.

While this sibling battle over the fate of the piano rages on, the home where Berniece lives with her Uncle and daughter also appears to be haunted by the ghost of a recently deceased descendant of the white family who once owned their ancestors as slaves.

I appreciate what Wilson's attempting to do here, and this play does illuminate some dark and difficult debates within the African-American community about how best to incorporate their ancestral Past, including the bitter legacy of slavery, into their Present lives as they struggle to survive and build a better future for themselves and their children (in the late 1930’s).

However, this lacked the intellectual spark or emotional resonance that made Ma Rainey's Black Bottom so memorable and compelling. The characters felt superficial and underdeveloped, more like symbols representing different schools of thought than unique and complex human beings. And the central metaphors of the piano and ghost felt a tad too contrived and heavy-handed for my taste, smashing the reader over the head like those grand pianos falling from the sky in the old cartoons.

This also lacked the crackling wit and comic relief I've come to expect from Wilson's plays. There are occasional flashes of brilliance and humor in the dialogue, but none of that unbridled, contagious joy found in the earlier plays. Everything just felt oddly disjointed and underdeveloped, meandering toward an abrupt ending that felt cheap and unearned.",2,1/11/2023,what is it with school books and having super abrupt and out-there endings,2,8/26/2016,Read this for school.,school-reads2,11/6/2016,"As delighted as I am that Mr. Wilson's plays exist and are readily performed, this is not my favorite of his works. August Wilson successfully inserts the story of a black family into the thirties in America, where they are so rarely found. His characters are witty, with clear voices and entirely human motivations. The struggle here is predictable: two siblings have a family inheritance and one wants to sell while the other does not. Their future, however, is tainted by the complex emotional damage of the past. Racial struggles are as much of their legacy as the color of their eyes and skin. Where this play loses ground, in my opinion, is with its all-too-literal insertion of the supernatural. Instead of the ghosts of the past looming suggestively like the family-scar-carved piano in the corner, or as a framing technique like in ""Hamlet"", in the climax Boy Willie gets into a knuckle-busting-punch-out with a spirit. Though Wilson's style successfully echoes that of the irreplaceable Arthur Miller, I prefer Miller's suggested rather than literal interpretation of emotional demons.",2,3/1/2017,"Honestly, I don't understand the ending. The play wasn't bad and I'll probably raise my rating if someone explains it to me, but it honestly felt like it was supposed to be 10 pages longer and they just cut it short. I flipped the page expecting more and was really disappointed.

I feel like this has happened with more books this year than any other year...

I swear I'm not dumb!

Or am I?",2,8/11/2008,"this play is an option in my curriculum. I don' t think my students would appreciate it, I myself was expecting something more teen friendly- I appreciate the ""lesson"" but don't think these are character's that my students will invest in.",2,8/9/2015,"Eh. It was okay. I mean... I kept reading it. But it is pretty short, and it's a play, so it wasn't a huge investment of time. Okay, so I wanted to know what happened, but the ending was pretty much a let-down. I was expecting something more Eugene O'Neill-ish.",2,6/13/2012,school,read-in-20112,7/19/2012,boring not me i read it because i had to for school but it was ok,2,4/10/2013,school again,2,6/3/2014,"Fine, in the way that most classics performed at your local theater are worth watching only if you know they're classics.",2,8/4/2014,"This was more of a ghost story and really nothing at all about a piano lesson. I did enjoy the African American dialogue, though I probably wouldn't go see the play if given the chance.",2,11/19/2019,"I first grabbed this book to read because my nephew had to read it in school and I typically like school required reading. This book, on the other hand, raised many questions rather than being an enjoyable read.
First of all, I don't understand why or how this book is approved by the school system. There are great, teachable books that have been removed from the ""school board approved"" list of literature that can be read in classrooms, because of how certain groups or certain people have found it to be offensive or racist. It's astonishing to me that people can have a book describing a little girl's thoughts and actual life events during the infamous Holocaust removed, but a fictitious book, using the ""n"" word that many people have been fired over is ok.
Secondly, the fact that the book was written in play format, for me, didn't allow me to really read it as a flowing story. Although, I did appreciate the format, because I think without it I would have been lost with the back and forth conversations between the characters.
I do love books that have a point to them or an underlying message, so I did enjoy the book in that aspect.",2,4/14/2024,"Read this one because it was chosen as the monthly pick by my local book club. I don't mind reading plays, mostly because I love Shakespeare. Unfortunately, this one didn't speak to me because there was a significant amount of ""locker-room talk"" from two of the male characters. They were always talking about picking-up women and wanting to know what the women where like in any given area. To me, the language used was just disrespectful, even if this play is set in a very different time period. I can usually handle such things because times were different back then, but I just wasn't of a mind to put up with it this time around. Not upset to have read this because it's so short, but I easily would have DNFed this book if it had been longer.",2,7/7/2025,"This play takes place in the 1930s and is part of Wilson's Century Cycle.

This is a play about Boy Willie visiting his sister, Bernice to get the family piano. Boy Willie wants to take this piano which has significant and sentimental value to the family and sell it to buy some land with the hope of generating generational wealth. Bernice wants to keep the piano that her father died for and represents their ancestry.

This play disappointed me as it is generally considered one of the best in the Cycle. Wilson uses ghosts in this play more than any other I have read and the confusion at the climax of the play just made me anxious. This story didn't ring true or as deep as the others.","african-american, family-heirloom, fiction, play"2,11/3/2020,"I thought The Piano Lesson was alright. Although, I did like reading it while watching Hallmark's rendition of the play itself. I did notice some pieces of dialogue were missing. However, it was not that big of a deal as it did tell the same story. It really helped having a visual while going through the text. I would recommend students to watch the play while they're reading. I find it beneficial to be able to hear the words on the page. I did enjoy the bits of humor the author included through the more serious dialogue. I feel like this piece can be taught to both middle and high schoolers. I think it can get a real conversation going.",2,1/26/2018,"I loved reading _Fences_ (and seeing the movie last year), and several of my College Prep Lit students with other English teachers really enjoyed reading _The Piano Lesson_, so I had high hopes. Unfortunately, I just didn't really get into it. The dialogue was incredibly well-captured, but it just seemed repetitive and boring. Those who read it in Book Club seemed to be of two minds: some felt as I did; others really enjoyed it.

I have never seen _The Piano Lesson_ on stage, and I suspect it would be quite engaging in that format.",2,9/17/2018,"So, I read this play for my Intro To Theatre class and, personally, it just wasn't for me. I know there are things to read into and metaphors and all, but it was just eh to me. Boy Willie was annoying for sure. The whole thing was somewhat repetitive and there was a moment with Lymon and Berniece that I thought was kind of random especially because it was largely ignored afterward. I don't know. Bottom line, I read this for class out of necessity. It wasn't my cup of tea though I know it was/is important to many people.",2,9/21/2023,"“See, you got north. You got west. You look over here you got south. Over there you got east. Now, you can start from anywhere. Don’t care where you at. You’ve got to go one of them four ways.”

It’s an interesting concept. One person wants to sell the piano for a better life, while the other wants to keep the piano in memory of the past. The characters were interesting too. somehow though, the story just wasn’t compelling.

I’m not sure why this would have won the Pulitzer. Probably would not recommend this one. “Fences” was better.",pulitzer-drama2,1/13/2021,"I really wanted to like this book. I kept waiting for something to happen, it took such a long time to get to the point and when it finally did I was disappointed.

It was a very quick read.",2,12/8/2021,"It was a really quick read, it was almost so short that is was difficult to become invested in the characters or overall plot. I found it hard to like any of the characters or really care about what was going on.

I think this is something that would be MUCH better to experience a a play rather than a book. You'll get a better feel for the characters and that would give you a better connection to them. It would also have more of an emotional impact.",book-club2,6/18/2019,"I had to read this in class. Do I add these on my goodreads account? Anyway I just wasn't the biggest fan of this one. No disrespect, but it wasn't my type of read.",2,8/23/2016,"I don't know. Maybe this is the kind of play that demands to be seen rather than read, because reading it is Boring with a capital B. Especially after reading Two Trains Running, which was full of such lively and interesting characters. This story just seems to drag on and on, and it doesn't even conclude in a satisfying fashion. By the end of it all, I really felt like I wasted my time. This is the worst play of his that I've read so far, Pulitzer prize notwithstanding. The story concerns a brother and sister fighting over a piano that has a lot of significance to their family tree. What follows is a lot of bland dialogue and dull characters. I had a hard time keeping my eyes open. I'm still going to read the rest of the cycle, but I'm a lot less stoked after reading this one. It sucked!",2,5/24/2017,"Well I had to read this for my English class that is specifically ""sounds/music in literature"" so naturally this is the first book of the semester. I wouldn't say I would have picked it up by myself just for the hell of it and I'll probably never read it ever again, but it wasn't entirely awful, especially since it was a book I had to read for school, which are notoriously terrible. The moral of the story was pretty obvious, but that's nice because it makes for an easy paper topic and there are lots of examples to be able to support the thesis. It was only 108 pages, so that also made it easier to power through when I actually sat down to read it.","2014, a-z-2014, had-to-read-for-school, my-reviews"2,6/14/2008,"I love instruement. I like to play piano. so i choose this book to read. In this book, it have the motif of ghost. where the Piano Lesson is appropriately haunted by ghosts: the ghost of Sutter, the Ghosts of the Yellow Dog, the ghosts of the ancestors, and, in a less supernatural sense, those of Crawley and Cleotha. This profusion of ghosts reveals a blending of Christian, folk/superstitious, and African mystical traditions. For example, the final exorcism or Avery's description of the Ghosts of the Yellow Dog as the ""hand of God.""",advisorybooks-07-082,4/23/2024,"I read this book for a class. I wouldn't say it was a difficult book but the script format definitely got in the way of the book flowing as I read it. I think there is a message in this book for anyone willing to listen about grappling with the good and bad of your personal history and your ancestor's choice. I'd recommend watching some version of this book in a performance format while you are reading it because on it own the book can kind of loose it'self in what I can only describe as a bit of filler. Worth the read if you have the time, but I wouldn't personally seek it out.",2,4/18/2010,"I don't like August Wilson, but it's just a matter of personal taste. For me, this play didn't establish enough meaning for the climax to be anything less than cheesy. I think it would be possible to change that with production decisions, but just reading the script, I can't suspend my disbelief enough for this to be effective.",2,5/20/2011,This play is worth giving another shot. I am interested to read the whole century cycle to boost my knowledge of African American history if nothing else; these plays are so well researched.,english-grad-school2,9/19/2011,"I thought the book was fun to read as summer homework, but I would definitely not read it in my spare time.",2,1/24/2023,Show don't tell.

Pretty good, I don't think I would mind reading any of his other plays. Tip though, I would watch the play before reading it because it makes it easier to visualize it.",2,2/27/2013,"Hated this play. Was very bored. It does have some fun characters, though.",2,9/27/2016,"This was okay, I wish more happened in it, though. It was pretty much uneventful.",didn-t-like-hated3,10/16/2016,"Another Wilson play that was just okay. I wanted to learn more about the piano, but the characters never really get around to explains what exactly is so important and symbolic about the piano that it must be kept within the family. I feel like this would be an amazing play to see onstage since the final scene has so much action and the characters have so much dialogue between themselves that causes for the reader to need to actually see it acted out instead of just reading it in a book.

I will say though, the one dimensional feel that was given to Avery's character (he's the love interest of one of the main characters) felt very robotic when he was simply quoting full passages from the bible just so that he could uphold his role as a ""preacher."" In a way, this character paled when read in tandem with Boy Willie, who was the main male character that was so impassioned about life.

Overall, my main problem with this play was that Wilson's failed once again to really reconcile the ending with the residing conflict in the play. Like with Gem of the Ocean, the story seemed to stop abruptly and the curtain just seems to fall down in the midst of the characters' squabble making me feel confused as to what the playwright was trying to convey to his audience. Therefore, while I did like this better than Gem of the Ocean, I still had to give it a mere 3 stars because I wasn't all the way sold on how the play ended. Definitely not Wilson's best play, but still worth the read at only a little over a 100 pages.",3,2/6/2017,"This is a 3.7 starred rating.

I continue my backward trajectory through August Wilson's Century Cycle with The Piano Lesson. If I had to based what I thought this play would be about solely on its title, I probably would have said this would be the most innocuous of his Cycle thus far. I would be wrong; way off the map and with good reason too.

The Piano Lesson takes place in 1936. On its surface, it's about a brother sister conflict. Little brother Boy Willie wants to sell of the family piano so he can buy some land. However, it's in older sister Berniece's possession and she is very adamant about keeping in the family.

At its heart, it's about ghosts, both literally and symbolically. Boy Willie sees selling the piano as a way to a certain kind of freedom. He can finally purchase land he believe is rightfully his and move on with his life. He can finally be ""somebody. "" Berniece believes the piano is a direct link to her family past and all of the sacrifice it took to bring it to the house. They're both haunted, one by the past and one by a possible future.

Then, they're actually haunted by Sutter, the former slaveowner of their family. He was supposedly pushed into a well by the Ghosts of the Yellow Dog, so named by the four black men who were burned alive in a boxcar of the train called the Yellow Dog. One of those men was Boy Willie and Berniece's father, Boy Charles.

A haunting that's caused by another haunting? Wilson knows how to use allegory and he does it extremely well. I enjoyed The Piano Lesson because it was not what I expected. I enjoyed the bitter family history. I saw where all sides were coming from. I tended to agree more with Berniece. Keeping the piano is not only mere sentimentality; it's palpable history of your roots. It's physical evidence of where you come from. However, I understood Boy Willie's side as well. Sometimes, you don't want to remember where you came from and be static. Sometimes, you need to break out and write a new history.",3,4/20/2017,"This is the fourth play in August Wilson's Century Cycle. This play was good. It was set in the 1930s and is about a man name Boy Willie who goes up north to Pittsburgh with his friend Lymon with intentions to sell the family piano in order to buy some land back south. Boy Willie's sister Berniece keeps the piano in her house and does not want to sell it. Tensions rise between the siblings until its dramatic conclusion.

As of this writing, out of the four Wilson plays that I have read I still think ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"" is the best one. Next up: Seven Guitars.",3,11/28/2011,"From BBC Radio 3:
August Wilson's play about a brother and sister and a piano carved with African faces.",3,4/22/2024,"not his best work, but still poignant and well-written in many ways. some parts feel too contrived and removed from the more raw characters he typically creates.",3,5/9/2023,"I'm so glad I was assigned this for my class! I loved the circular and very realistic, funny dialogue in this play and I loved the use of song and music. Boy Willie's and Berniece's central conflict highlighted the tensions between race and gender as well as the lasting impacts of slavery effectively.",3,9/20/2010,"This is a sweet play dealing with the issue of race relations, naturally a common theme among African American authors. But this has some humor and grace to it and I would have liked to see it performed.",3,2/7/2021,"A story about family, ghosts, and a piano that brings them together and apart.",3,2/7/2022,"Seems like August Wilson spent 95% of his time coming up with nuanced symbolism and 5% coming up with a boring plot to fit that symbolism. Cool ending, though.",3,6/4/2024,"Poor Berniece dealing with these annoying a** men. If you thought any man in the story would have something of substance to say (men account for 90% of the dialogue), well that's too d*mn bad. Good point made? It's undercut by dumba**ery about the piano or male bravado.

Now this is a great period piece about the black experience. August Wilson is a phenomenal writer. But. Just give me Raisin in the Sun or Fences. I can't listen to these men yap anymore.",3,3/23/2010,"In The Piano Lesson August Wilson presents a charming tale centered on reconciling the past with the present. Much of the story centers on ghosts, both literal and figurative, and how best to put those spectres aside and move on with life. Although much of the plot revolves around the power struggle between Bernice and Boy Willie over control of the piano, the piano seems merely a metaphor for deciding the future direction of this extended family.
From the moment that Boy Willie arrives, Bernice acts coldly. It seems apparent the she is suspicious of his motives, as there is not the warm welcome one would expect when encountering a sibling one has not seen in a while. The animosity she seems to carry becomes more obvious as the story progresses, yet one does not become aware of her reason until it is revealed that she blames Boy Willie for the death of Crawley. When Boy Willie announces his intention to take the piano it sets up the conflict for the play as well as confirms her suspicions surrounding his visit. Her resentments towards Boy Willie for past deeds are now transferred to the present scenario.
Wilson does a wonderful job of revealing the significance and history surrounding the piano. Not only does this heirloom contain the carvings of the family’s ancestral past but one also learns that Bernice and Boy Willie’s father died stealing the piano. It was not simply a heist for financial gain however. Their father believed that until the piano was free from Sutter and in the families own hands that they would continue to be held back in the future. His theft of the piano was necessary for the future of the family. That leads to the central conflict of the story, as Boy Willie’s desire to sell the piano is driven by his desire to purchase land for his and the family’s future. As Sutter has passed away, Boy Willie has the opportunity to purchase his land and the only means available to fund the purchase is ironically through the sale of the piano that his father died stealing.
Bernice is firmly rooted in the past, not only in regards to the family heirloom but in her personal life as well. Despite the passage of years, she still has not gotten over the death of Crawley. The family seems very encouraging of Avery’s talk of marriage and yet Bernice seems to reject his suggestions. This sets up another conflict between living in the past and moving on into the future. It is very similar to her position on the piano. She has not played the piano in many years, and in many ways resents it, yet does not desire to let go of it and move on with her life. There is no reason to believe she doubts Boy Willie’s scheme to use the money from the piano to secure the farm and a better life, but she is determined to hold on to the piano. Determined not to play it nor let it go, it mirrors her relationship with Avery.
These conflicts lead to the final moments of the play where a fight ensues between Willie Boy and Sutter’s ghost. The ghost can only be stopped through Bernice playing the piano, reconciling her past and present. It is a moment that is powerfully symbolic, yet so contrived that it is quite a letdown. Of course, there is certainly nothing new about playwrights resorting to deus ex machina to resolve the storyline, yet the same criticisms apply that have for centuries. It tends to leave the reader unsatisfied, almost cheated, by the playwright resorting to taking the easy way out. August Wilson spends one-hundred pages creating a story that is engaging to the reader, compelling one to see both sides of this complex issue and in six short pages manages to make it seem like a farcical waste of time. Wilson was certainly capable of better and resorting to such an ending mars what was otherwise a very enjoyable read.",3,4/25/2020,"I'm sure it's better to see this performed than to read it silently! However, the foreword by Toni Morrison commends reading it for all the nuances and without actors’ interpretations. After I sit with it awhile, I may give it another star.
Read for Book Riot 2020 Read Harder Challenge, category: play by an author of color",3,4/27/2014,"I had hoped to feel the same emotional sting I once felt with The Autobiography of Malcolm X while reading August Wilson's The Piano Lesson (winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1990--and another book that may yet sneak its way into my curriculum). A lynch-pin in Wilson's ""Pittsburgh Cycle"" (covering 100 years of African-American experiences largely in and around one neighborhood of the Steel City) it's a tightly wound family drama about the past, and the future.

I love reading dramatic literature, I can hunker down with a collection of plays and mentally cast the roles, hear the line readings, imagine some staging and set dressing and contemplate just how it all works (or doesn't). Wilson's text certainly has some wonderful themes and emphatic performances to draw from.

At the center of the play is a piano (obviously), a symbol of the family's enslaved and beholden past, now at the cusp of being repurposed as a chance for liberation. But would selling it, be stealing from yourself? Stealing your history? Your memory? Your greatest inspiration to change?

That's the conflict between Boy Willie and his sister Bernice. A striving, scrambling, angst-riddled conflict, that demands each character to choose how they want to focus their lives: around the past, present, or future.

The comings and goings of other characters add to the philosophical debate, but at it's core it's a drama for that family. A more visceral, defiant form of conflict than the segmented Raisin in the Sun, but just as emotionally potent. It doesn't sing on the page, but it's easy to imagine with the right casting (Samuel L. Jackson's debut role as Boy Willie sounds like perfect casting).

But for whatever reason, I just couldn't fully grasp The Piano Lesson. Maybe it was that I didn't fully grasp the setting, or that I felt that the central conflict between past and future (all symbolized by the fate of a family heirloom piano) was obvious from the start, or that the climactic confrontation with the supernatural was somehow both too convenient and too complicated to fully understand.

Or maybe it's that I'm white. The familial history and the future that surrounds the play is no where near my realm of experience--so it's reasonable that it didn't hit me the same way that a play with even a single white character (like Master Harold and the Boys) does. I don't mean to excuse myself from comprehension, or Wilson from literary inconsistency, but I think that the flaws of The Piano Lesson read differently to me than they might to someone else.",
